Manual CI setup

•	On GitLab server:
  o	Created a new repo, copied down the address:
     	git@10.0.0.41:marcolcal/cicd-pipeline.git
  o	Added local ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the SSH keys on Gitlab (http://10.0.0.41/profile/keys)
  o	Cloned the repo to my local machine, git add "index.html" and "build.py" from the other repo, git commit, git push
•	On Jenkins server:
  o	Opened up Jenkins in the browser
  o	SSH in and grabed the admin key, entered it in the browser, ran through the setup wizard
  o	Created a new job
  o	Set the Repositories -> Git -> Repository URL= git@10.0.0.41:marcolcal/cicd-pipeline.git
  o	Changed Branches to build -> Branch specifier -> (empty for all)
  o	Set Build Triggers -> Poll SCM -> Schedule to * * * * * (every minute pulls)
  o	Added a new shell build step, set the command to “python build.py”
  o	Triggered a build if you want(failed)
  o	SSH setup on Jenkins server:
 	As root, I ran these steps:
    •	ssh-keygen -t rsa
    •	sudo mv ~/.ssh/ /var/lib/jenkins  (jenkins default home dir)
    •	sudo chown jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
 	Also as root, edited /etc/passwd and changed /bin/false to /bin/bash on the Jenkins user:
      jenkins:x:996:993:Jenkins Automation Server:/var/lib/jenkins:/bin/bash
    •	Copied the /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and added it to the production and preprod /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys
    •	Added the same id_rsa.pub to the Gitlab SSH keys, same as done with the local user
    •	Grab the IP of the production and preprod servers and modified /etc/hosts on the Jenkins server like this:
        o	10.0.0.117 production-server.com
        o	10.0.0.232 stage-server.com
    •	sudo su - jenkins
        o	ssh vagrant@production-server.com
        o	ssh vagrant@stage-server.com 
        o	Accept the host keys for both hosts

After host keys are set up, I triggered another build on Jenkins and it succeed. The production server should display the latest version of index.html in master.

To test the staging -> master workflow, did these steps on your local copy of the repo:
   o	git pull
   o	git checkout -b my_new_branch
   o	(make some changes to the index.html)
   o	git add index.html
   o	git commit -m “Commit message goes here”
   o	git push -u origin my_new_branch
   o	(waited 60 seconds, Jenkins picked up the new branch and pushed to the staging server, verified change is showing in the browser)
   o	Went to the GitLab interface, switched to the branch view, created a new Merge Request for the branch just created.
   o	Submitted the merge request and click Merge, these change should land in master.
   o	(waited another 60 seconds, Jenkins trigger a build for master, which updated the production server, verified in the browser)
   o	Locally, I switched back to master and pull to get the latest changes: git checkout master; git pull

Thats is folks!!!
